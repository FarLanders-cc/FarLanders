# FarLanders

> **Open-source project from `farlanders.cc`**

FarLanders is the primary plugin for a Minecraft server that has a unique world generation feature, allowing players to explore the Far Lands.

## World Generation

The world generation is based on the Far Lands concept, which is a phenomenon in Minecraft where the terrain becomes distorted and chaotic at extreme distances from the center of the world. This plugin implements a custom world generator that creates these unique landscapes.

- The noise generation is based on [OpenSimplex2](https://github.com/KdotJPG/OpenSimplex2).
